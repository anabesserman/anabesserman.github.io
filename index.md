Full Name: Ana Elisa Piani Besserman Vianna

contact: pianibes@usc.edu

I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at the University of Southern California. I investigate discourse-level phenomena in language comprehension and production using a variety of experimental methods, such as self-paced reading, eye-tracking and story continuation tasks.

I am currently a member of Elsi Kaiser's Language Processes Lab at USC.
